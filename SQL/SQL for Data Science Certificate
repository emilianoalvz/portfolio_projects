Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	i. Attribute table =	10000 
	ii. Business table =	10000 	
	iii. Category table =	10000 
	iv. Checkin table =	10000 
	v. elite_years table =	10000 
	vi. friend table = 	10000 
	vii. hours table =	10000 
	viii. photo table = 	10000 
	ix. review table = 	10000 
	x. tip table = 		10000 
	xi. user table =	10000 
	
	SQL Code: 
	Select Count(*) From Table


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	i. Business =			10000 	(id)
	ii. Hours =			1562 	(business_id)	
	iii. Category =			2643 	(business_id)
	iv. Attribute =			1115 	(business_id)
	v. Review =			10000	(id),		8090 (business_id), 	9581 (user_id)
	vi. Checkin = 			493 	(business_id)
	vii. Photo =			10000	(id),		6493 (business_id)
	viii. Tip = 			537	(user_id),      3979 (business_id)
	ix. User = 			10000	(id)
	x. Friend = 			11	(user_id)
	xi. Elite_years =		2780	(user_id)

	Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No 
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	Select * From user
	where id is null

		order by (review_count) desc 
		limit 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		+--------+--------------+

		| Sara   |         1629 |
		| Yuri   |         1339 |
		+--------+--------------+		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
		No
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		We can clearly see, for example that the person with the most fans, Amy,
		has made 'only' 609 reviews, compared with Harald, that has made 1153 reviews,
		and has 311 fans.
		On the other hand, the person that has made the most reviews, Gerald, has 253 fans,
		which we can say, it is practically half the fans of Amy.
	
	SQL code 
		select name, review_count, fans 
		from user 
		order by fans desc
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, there is more reviews with the word "love"
		+------+-------------+
		| Word | Total Count |
		+------+-------------+
		| hate |         232 |
		| love |        1780 |
		+------+-------------+
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
		select "love" Word, count(*) "Total Count"
		from review
		where text like "%love%"
		UNION 
		select "hate" Word, count(*) "Total Count"
		from review 
		where text like "%hate%"

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
		select name, fans from user
		order by fans desc
		limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	I chose the Category of "Restaurants" for Las Vegas 
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	No, for example "Big Wong Restaurant" has the same distribution of hours than
	"Wingstop", but Big Wong has 4 stars and Wingstop 3.
	On the other hand, "Jacques Cafe" has shorter working hours and they also have 4 stars.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes, Big Wong has 768 reviews and is rated with 4 stars, so it is a very popular place with good reputation. 
	Jacques Cafe and Wingstop have moreless the same reviews, 168 vs 123 respectively,
	but maybe Wingstop is lacking something in their service or products, since they have 3 stars.
        
	Another reason could be that Big Wong is Asian Food, and Wingstop American/Chicken Wings, 
	and people in general prefer Asian food. 
	Also because Vegas is an international destination and Big Wong could be very famous or one 
	of those "bucket list" places to visit.

	
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	It could be possible that there's a correlation between the Location (Income Per Capita) and the Stars.
	For this I used the visualization tool ArcGIS of Power BI to see the Income per Capita by region and zip code.
	Then I introduced the Address to see the income by region, by color: 
		Green = High income or Above avg, 
		Light brown = Avg,
		Purple = Below avg. 
	It turned out that Big Wong is in a light brown area (avg income), 4 stars.
	Jacques Cafe at a green area (high income or above avg), 4 stars. 
	Wingstop is at a purple area (low income or below avg), 3 stars.
	This was just a visual representation, but it is not conclusive since I cannot obtain the correlation index,
	between the variables, but it was interesting. 
	
	One inference that may be truth is that Jacques Cafe is placed at a High income area, and they offer 
	food that may be a little more expensive than usual, such as Vegan, Gluten-Free, French and Brunches. 
	
SQL code used for analysis:
	select 
	b.name, b.city, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count, b.address
	from business b
	Join hours h
	on b.id = h.business_id
	join category c 
	on b.id = c.business_id
	WHERE city = 'Las Vegas' AND category = "Restaurants"
	order by review_count desc

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones 
that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: 
    The closed places have a lower average of stars     
         
ii. Difference 2:
    The open places have 7.5 times more reviews than the closed places 
	269K vs 35K 
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT 
	count(distinct id) id, 
	sum(review_count) reviews, 
	avg(stars) avg_stars,
	avg(review_count) avg_reviews,
	is_open Open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open 

Table: 
	+------+---------+---------------+---------------+------+
	|   id | reviews |     avg_stars |   avg_reviews | Open |
	+------+---------+---------------+---------------+------+
	| 1520 |   35261 | 3.52039473684 | 23.1980263158 |    0 |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset
 and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find 
commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. 
These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    I chose to analyze the average stars by their review_count, this in order to see 
	the places with the best average, the most recommended places and the least (from 3 stars down),
	and the worst from the app. 
	and I performed 3 analysis:
	1. The places with most reviews and their ratings (avg stars)
	2. Places with the highest ratings based on their review_count
	3. Places with the worst ratings based on their review_count (3 stars down)
	4. Worst places of the app
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    I used the stars and the review_count to compare each other, and also the name, city and category
	to label that data.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

	1. Most Reviews and their ratings:
